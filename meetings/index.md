# <i class="fas fa-tools"></i>Overview

Scalable System Lab group meetings generally occur on Fridays at 2:00pm in Room 2410 of the Farris Engineering Center. Both student lab members and those interested in our research are welcome to attend, though meetings generally have a set agenda (e.g. status, paper discussion, or resource development) as showwn in the list below. Both current and perspective groups members are more than welcome to attend. In addition, the lab also participates in a number of colloquia and other groups that also hold meetings. The meeting is also occasionally available via zoom by arrangement with Prof. Bridges.
