# New Website

Hey everyone, today all of us in the SSL got together for a hacking session to put together a new website for the SSL. This is our first blog post! This is the first in a while that the info about the SSL has been updated so be sure to take a look at everything we have to offer here. Be sure to look at our resources page to see the videos we made during last year's "Scalable System Seminar" which should act as a tutorial and introduction for any new students to the lab, or anyone else who is interested in doing the kind of research we work on here!
