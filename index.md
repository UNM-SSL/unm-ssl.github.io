The Scalable Systems Lab is a research laboratory in the Computer Science Department at the University of New Mexico. 
We collaborate closely with the UNM Center for Advanced Research Computing, the Scalable Computing Systems Department at Sandia National Laboratories, the Computer and Computational Sciences Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and research groups at a variety of corporations, for example Cray and Intel.

# Highlights

{% capture text %}
Lab research focuses on research, design, and implementation of operating systems, runtime systems, libraries, and system services that enable complex, large scale applications. 
Research in this area over the years has resulted in operating systems and communication services that form the basis of modern HPC operating systems.

The resources and tools our lab maintains include research artifacts like operating systems, communication libraries, and data sets resulting from research, tutorials and other introductory information to help new researchers get started with the kinds of research we do, and links to useful information (e.g. standards and guides) that other groups maintain..

Members of the SSL team include both its current and former leadership, the current postdocs and students who are learning to perform and lead research in the lab, and a parade of alumni who have moved on from their days in the lab to other efforts but are still important members of our community.
